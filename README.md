# Vision-Based Moving Object

## 1. Introduction
Moving Object component is addressing moving objects based on messages generated by
Object Analytics [ros2_object_analytics](https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_analytics).
ros2_moving_object delivers further analysis for the localized and tracked objects from Object Analytics by adding **motion information**, i.e., the **velocity** information about tracked objects. Such information can extend robot's ability of motion planing and collision avoidance.

Thanks to [ros2_object_analytics](https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_analytics) and [ros2_intel_movidius_ncs](https://github.com/intel/ros2_intel_movidius_ncs) to provide an AI solution for object detection, tracking and localization. See [the umbrella wiki page](http://wiki.ros.org/intelrosproject) to learn the hierarchical data flow and overview description for the related components.

This component involves 2 ROS2 packages:
- **moving_object**: the main package covering logic of moving object analysis and information generation.
- **moving_object_msgs**: the message package storing the motion information of moving objects and published into ROS2 system.

## 2. Output Topics

ros2_moving_object package publishes some messages to indicate different status/data.
 - **/moving\_object/moving\_objects** merges info from the 3 input messages into one message and calculating (on demand) the velocity info of the tracked moving objects.

## 4. Build Steps
 1. Make sure ros2 core packages are built successfully. Please follow [this guide](https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki/Installation) for building and installing ros2 core packages.

 2. Make sure [ros2_message_filters](https://github.com/intel/ros2_message_filters) and [ros2_object_analysis_msgs](https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_analytics)) are built and installed successfully. If not, follow below steps (note that the path between < and > should be customized according to your real environment):
  ```bash
  source </ros2/install/dir>/local_setup.bash
  cd </my/overlay_ws/dir>/src
  git clone https://github.com/intel/ros2_message_filters.git
  git clone https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_analytics.git
  cd ..
  ament build --symlink-install
  ```
 3. Build Moving Object Component
  ```bash
  cd </my/overlay_ws/dir>/src
  source </ros2/dir>/local_setup.bash
  git clone https://github.com/intel/ros2_moving_object.git
  cd ..
  ament build --symlink-install
  ```

## 5. Launch Steps
  1. *[In terminal 1]* Launch realsense camera node.
  ```bash
  source </ros2/install/dir>/local_setup.bash
  source </my/overlay_ws/dir>/install/local_setup.bash
  realsense_ros2_camera
  ```
  2. *[In terminal 2]* Launch object analysis node.
  ```bash
  source </ros2/install/dir>/local_setup.bash
  source </my/overlay_ws/dir>/install/local_setup.bash
  echo -e "param_file: alexnet.yaml\ninput_topic: /object_analytics/rgb > src/ros2_intel_movidius_ncs/movidius_ncs_launch/config/default.yaml"
  launch `ros2 pkg prefix object_analytics_launch`/share/object_analytics_launch/launch/analytics_movidius_ncs.py
  ```
  3. *[In terminal 3]* Launch moving object node.
  ```bash
  source </ros2/install/dir>/local_setup.bash
  source </my/overlay_ws/dir>/install/local_setup.bash
  ros2 run moving_object moving_object
  ```
